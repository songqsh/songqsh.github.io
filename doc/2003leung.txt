Title: Dynamic Index Tracking and Risk Exposure Control Using Derivatives

Abstract:

A common challenge faced by many institutional and retail investors is to 
effectively control risk exposure to various market factors. There is a great 
variety of indices designed to provide different types of exposures across 
sectors and asset classes. Some of these indices can be difficult or impossible 
to trade directly, but investors can trade the associated financial derivatives
 if they are available in the market. For example, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), 
often referred to as the fear index, is not directly tradable, but investors can gain 
exposure to the index and potentially hedge against market turmoil by trading 
futures and options written on VIX.

We develop a methodology for index tracking and risk exposure control using 
financial derivatives. Under a continuous-time diffusion framework for price evolution, 
we present a pathwise approach to construct dynamic portfolios of derivatives in order to 
gain exposure to an index and/or market factors that may be not directly tradable. 
A general tracking condition is established to relate the portfolio drift to the desired 
exposure coefficients under any given model. We derive the slippage process that 
reveals how the portfolio return deviates from the targeted return. In our multi-factor setting, 
the portfolio's realized slippage depends not only on the realized variance of the index, 
but also the realized covariance among the index and factors. Trading strategies are 
implemented under a number of models using different derivatives, such as futures and options.
