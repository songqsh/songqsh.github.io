- Title:  A C^{0,1}-functional Ito formula and its applications in finance
- Abstract: We obtain a functional (path-dependent) extension of the Ito formula for C^{0,1} functions in Bandini and Russo (2017). We then provide some original applications in finance of this new formula, by considering an option replication problem and a super-replication problem.
