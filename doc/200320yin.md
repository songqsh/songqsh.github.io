- Abstract: In this talk, we present some of our recent works on stochastic dynamic systems that 
stem from biological and ecological systems, social networks, controlled systems. The first part 
is concerned with Kolmogorov systems with random disturbances. We use a particular model to 
illustrate the study, which arises in mathematical models of infectious diseases and social networks. 
We obtain minimal conditions for long-term persistence and extinction. The second part is concerned 
with switching diffusions, which is motivated by, for example, consensus formation and networked systems. 
We study recurrence and numerical solutions for controlled switching diffusions.
